<br>
<p1>Francium is an inorganic product made from the decay process of Actinium. Actinium is a type of radioactive medicine.</p1>
<br>
<p2>This is a chemical on the periodic table of elements. It's symbol is Fr and it's atomic number is 87.</p2>
<br>
<p3>One facture that makes this a very hard poison to use is it completly decays in only 22 minutes limiting its use. </p3>
<br>
<p4>Francium can damage your cells and potentially cause cancer.</p4>
<br>
<p5>Francium can be found within uranium minerals like autine, monazite, and uraninite.</p5>
<br>
<p6>It is very hard to use Francium to kill someone because you would need a lot of it and it is hard to acquire a large amount of francium. Though it does cause lots of harm due to radiation.</p6>
<br>
<p7>It is very expanisve to make so expenisve that producing 100 grams of francium would cost billions of dollars.</p7>
